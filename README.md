# HS Fulda - Software Development Project

## Project description: Java parsing for advanced eLearning tasks

Goal of the project is to process java Code submitted by students to supply feedback by flexibly defined rules. Feedback should analyze the code using the JavaParser library, and be capable of detecting the presence or absence of certain constructs (for loop, while loop, if statement etc.). Typical example exercise: print all values in an array without using a for loop!

### Week 1 Todos (19 April 2018) 

- Setup initial project with Github.
- Think about the format of the rules files, make a UML diagram.
- Integrate the JavaParser in our Java program.
- Parse the running “Hello World” Java code using our Program and generate an AST(Abstract Syntax Tree).
